Error-based SQL injection refers to cases where you're able to use error messages to either extract or infer sensitive data from the database, even in blind contexts. 
You can modify the query so that it causes a database error only if the condition is true.
 These inputs use the CASE keyword to test a condition and return a different expression depending on whether the expression is true:

    With the first input, the CASE expression evaluates to 'a', which does not cause any error.
    With the second input, it evaluates to 1/0, which causes a divide-by-zero error.
 AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (Username = 'Administrator' AND SUBSTRING(Password, 1, 1) > 'm') THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END FROM Users)='a
