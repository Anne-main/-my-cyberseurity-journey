💻 My Cybersecurity Journey

Hey there! 👋 I’m Anne, and this repo is where I’m documenting my cybersecurity learning journey. I may be starting a bit late, but that doesn’t matter — it’s all about progress, one step at a time.

🎯 Purpose of This Repo

I created this repo to:

Document what I learn – from Nmap scans to malware analysis and beyond.

Track my progress – so I can look back and see how far I’ve come.

Experiment safely – practice commands and labs in a controlled, ethical environment.

Keep resources handy – notes, cheat sheets, and guides all in one place.

Share my journey – maybe inspire others who are starting their cybersecurity path.

🛠️ What I’m Learning

Here’s a snapshot of the topics I’m currently exploring:

Networking & host discovery

Nmap scans (ports, services, OS detection)

Linux basics for cybersecurity

Virtual lab setup (VMs & Docker)

Malware analysis fundamentals

Ethical hacking techniques

(And more as I go!)

📂 How This Repo is Organized
/nmap-notes       → Notes on Nmap commands, outputs, and concepts
/labs             → Lab exercises and writeups
/malware-analysis → Malware research notes
README.md         → My journey overview

🚀 My Goals

Short-term: Complete Nmap & Wireshark labs, practice on TryHackMe and HackTheBox.

Long-term: Build strong ethical hacking skills and eventually work on real-world penetration testing projects.

📚 Resources I’m Using

Nmap Official Book

TryHackMe Labs

HackTheBox Academy

YouTube cybersecurity tutorials

💡 Note to Future Me

Even if I started documenting late, every note, every lab, and every mistake is part of the journey. One step at a time, I’m building the skills I need to become a proficient cybersecurity professional.
