# WiFi Security Challenge #1 🔐

### Date: 11 December 2025

## 🎯 Objective
Practice and understand how dictionary attacks work in WiFi security using a test scenario.

## 🧠 What I Practiced
- Understanding how WiFi passwords can be weak
- Basics of password attacks
- Wordlists and how they work
- Thinking through attack logic

## 📝 What Happened
Today I encountered a real situation that reminded me of what I’ve been learning in cybersecurity.  
I challenged myself to test whether I could identify a weak password using basic techniques — and I succeeded faster than I expected.

This made me realise:
- I *can* apply what I learn  
- I think logically  
- I have potential in cybersecurity  
- I'm improving in problem-solving  

## 💡 Key Lessons Learned
- Weak passwords are still very common
- Dictionary attacks work when people use predictable passwords
- Cybersecurity isn’t about hacking illegally — it’s about understanding vulnerabilities so we can fix them
- Confidence grows when you solve real problems



This journey is about becoming a responsible cybersecurity professional.
